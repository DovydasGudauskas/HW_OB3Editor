# Hostile Waters .OB3 File Editor
Uses Visual studio 2019

## Features:
1. List all objects
2. List all objects in detail
3. Find object
4. Add object
5. Edit object
6. Remove object
7. Save file (duhh)
8. Use meters instead of game units
9. Crappy Randomizer

## Note
It closely works with the .S0U file (the one which loads the model meshes). If the object you have added is missing from the .S0U, the game will crash!
